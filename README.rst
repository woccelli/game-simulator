Project created in the scope of a master thesis entitled "Game-theoretic optimizations for honeypot deployment in AMI networks" by William Occelli.

The goal of this project is to simulate an evolutionary game where multiple players encounter and confront over several generations.
Attackers (hackers) and Defenders (network administrators) are the two main types of players. Variations are introduced for each type of player in order to create populations. 
We introduce the ability to deploy honeypots (lures) for Defenders in order to deceive Attackers, however, these honeypots come with a deployment cost and populations of Defender confront each other with a fitness parameter corresponding to this involved defense cost. 

To understand the basic principles of the project, we recommend users to read the document "Game-theoretic optimizations for honeypot deployment in AMI networks" by William Occelli and refer to the comments written in the "game-simulator/game" package of this project.
